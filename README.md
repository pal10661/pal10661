- 👀 I’m interested in lots of stuff but professionally scientific coding is perhaps the thing ( number crunching, engineering apps ) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to use this GitHub system. I have used similar systems before but this is my first time with GitHub
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ? ( I actually do not know yet ).
